# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator


### Overview

In this project, I used ternary operators to make decisions based on various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks.


### Reflections

- **Ternary Operators**: The only operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.


#### Challenges Faced

-None
-This  project was straight forward. This was because of the resources I used to familiarise myself with ternary operators.


#### Areas for Improvement

- **Ternary Operators**: There are different ways to approach ternary operators. I am trying to improve my skills in that aspect.


#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was an invaluable hands-on experience in applying ternary operators. It helped solidify my understanding of ternary operators. I look forward to building on these skills in future projects.
